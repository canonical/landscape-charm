upgrade:
  description: |
    Upgrade software on the Landscape Server unit. This will update
    APT package indices and upgrade the landscape-server package. Unit must
    already be paused using the 'pause' action. If upgrading from a version
    of Landscape Server earlier than 25.10, it is recommended to run the
    migrate-service-conf action prior to upgrading.

  description: |
    Upgrade the Landscape database schemas on the related databases.
    Unit must already be paused using the 'pause' action.
hash-id-databases:
  description: |
    Regenerate the package hash to id mapping files that are used to
    speed up client package reporting.
migrate-service-conf:
  description: |
    Rewrite the service.conf file on each unit, replacing deprecated
    fields with the new ones. This action is idempotent and only needs
    to be run if Landscape Server 25.10 or later is installed, but the
    service.conf file was configured by an earlier version of Landscape
    Server.
